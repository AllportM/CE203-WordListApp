# CE203-WordListApp
Simple application using jswing to create a word list application with user interface  
  
This is a very simple application, created for CE203 - Application programming assignment 1 in which we were tasked with creating an application with user interface allowing the user to store words, find words ending with a specific letter, changing the color of the display box, and clearing the word list.
